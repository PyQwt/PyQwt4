What is PyQwt?

- it is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library which
  extends the Qt framework with widgets for scientific and engineering
  applications.   It provides a widget to plot 2-dimensional data and
  various widgets to display and control bounded or unbounded floating
  point values.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it supports the use of PyQt, Qt, Qwt, the Numerical Python extensions
  (any combination of NumPy, numarray, and Numerice) and optionally
  SciPy in a GUI Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, MacOS/X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).
 
The home page of PyQwt is http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net.

New features in PyQwt-4.2.1 are:
1. support for NumPy.
2. upgrade to PyQt-3.16 and its code generator SIP-4.4.x.
3. PyQwt-4.2.1 can coexist with the PyQwt5 snapshots (or future
   releases) for Qt-3 and Qt-4

PyQwt-4.2.1 requires:
1. Python-2.4.x or -2.3.x.
2. PyQt-3.16 and SIP-4.4.x.
4. Qt-3.3.x or -3.2.x.
