Changes in PyQwt-4.2.1:
- support for the new numerical Python extension: NumPy.
- fixed the wrapper for QwtData.copy()
- slight reorganization of the package layout to so that PyQwt4 for
  Qt3 can coexist with the future PyQwt5 for Qt3 and Qt4. 
- a bug in the zooming of the included qwt-4.2.0 library has been fixed.
- the pyqt distutils installation facilities have been removed.
