What is PyQwt ( http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net ) ?

- it is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library which
  extends the Qt framework with widgets for scientific and engineering
  applications.   It provides a widget to plot 2-dimensional data and
  various widgets to display and control bounded or unbounded floating
  point values.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it supports the use of PyQt-3, Qt-3, Qwt-4.2, the Numerical Python
  extensions (any combination of NumPy, numarray, and Numeric) and optionally
  SciPy in a GUI Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).

- PyQwt-4.2.3 can coexist with PyQwt-5.0.x (for Qt-3 and Qt-4)
 
The home page of PyQwt is http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net.

New features and bug fixes in PyQwt-4.2.3 are:
- support for SIP-4.7, and PyQt-3.17.3.
- support for the N-D array interface specification
  ( http://numpy.scipy.org/array_interface.shtml ) allows to copy data out
  of NumPy arrays without enabling support for NumPy during the compilation
  of PyQwt.
- the iqt module also supports an interactive Python session without the
  help of the GNU readline module.
- removal of a huge memory leak in the conversion from an array to a QImage.


PyQwt-4.2.3 supports:
1. Python-2.5.x, or -2.4.x.
2. PyQt-3.17.x.
3  SIP-4.7.x, or -4.6.x.
4. Qt-3.3.x, or -3.2.x.
