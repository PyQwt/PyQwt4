What is PyQwt?

- it is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library which
  extends the Qt framework with widgets for scientific and engineering
  applications.   It provides a widget to plot 2-dimensional data and
  various widgets to display and control bounded or unbounded floating
  point values.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it supports the use of PyQt, Qt, Qwt, the Numerical Python extensions
  (any combination of NumPy, numarray, and Numeric) and optionally
  SciPy in a GUI Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).

- PyQwt-4.2.2 can coexist with the PyQwt5 snapshots (or future releases)
  for Qt-3 and Qt-4
 
The home page of PyQwt is http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net.

Changes and new features in PyQwt-4.2.2 are:
1. port to with Python-2.5
2. port to with MSVS-8.0 on Windows XP64 and Python-2.4.3
3. change anynumpy.py so that the examples work with numpy-1.0
4. enable parallel build on Mac OS X
5. add the SymbolPlotCurveDemo.py example
6. bug fix in the QwtPlotLayout class

PyQwt-4.2.2 requires:
1. Python-2.5, -2.4 or -2.3. 
2. PyQt-3.16 and SIP-4.4.x (Python-2.5 requires PyQt and SIP snapshots).
4. Qt-3.3.x or -3.2.x.
